# Inverse Matrix

## Task Description

The program must compute the inverse of a given matrix \( A^{-1} \).

### Input Format

- The first line of the input file contains two numbers: the dimensions of the matrix, **R** (rows) and **C** (columns).
- The next **R** lines contain **C** numbers each, separated by spaces. 
- Lines are separated by newline characters.
- The input is guaranteed to be correctly formatted (all input consists of numbers, and no arbitrary characters are present).
- **R** and **C** are natural numbers.

### Output Format

- The first line of the output file must contain **R** and **C**.
- The following **R** lines must contain **C** numbers each, formatted as `%g`.
- If the matrix is not invertible, the output must contain only the phrase **"no_solution"**.
- The last character in the output file must be a newline (`\n`).
